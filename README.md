This is my project "Expense Tracker"

This application will allow you to control your income and expenses. It is possible to give a name to the transaction, and the history of all your income and expenses will also be displayed with the possibility of deletion. Prices will be indicated in dollars, if you specify the price, this transaction will be sent to income, and if you put "-" in front of the price, then to expenses.
